<!--ABOUT THE PROJECT-->
## About the Project 

[Note: This project is still in ongoing development]

scribble is a web application that acts as both an online journal and a mood tracker for users. With scribble, users can log in, create an entry and have a main dashboard where they are able to keep track and view their recent entries.

The two main motivations for this project:

+ I wanted an online personal journal but with some additional features inspired by other journaling apps (i.e. Daylio, Reflectly)
+ I wanted to create my own first full-stack application and attempt to implement good coding practices along the way
