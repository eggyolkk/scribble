<!--ABOUT THE PROJECT-->
## About the Project 

scribble! is a web application that acts as both an online journal and a mood tracker for users. Users can log in, create an entry and have a main dashboard where they are able to keep track and view their entries.

This project was inspired by similar journaling mobile apps (such as Reflectly, Daylio etc.). I wanted to create a personal online web journal that I could tailor according to my preferences. Through this project, I wanted to get hands-on experience with creating a full-stack application, implementing JWT authentication, learning Redux and deploying the application on a cloud platform.
